# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview

**This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on several medical attributes such as:**
1- Age    
2- Glucose level    
3- Blood pressure    
4- Skin thickness    
5- Insulin level    
6- BMI (Body Mass Index)    
7- And other related features.    
8- Using Machine Learning algorithms, the model learns patterns from historical data to classify a person as diabetic or non-diabetic.

## 🧠 Objective

**Build a Classification Model that can predict:**    
1 → The person has diabetes    
0 → The person does not have diabetes

## 🧩 Dataset

📊 Dataset Name: Pima Indians Diabetes Database    
📥 Source: Kaggle - Diabetes Dataset    
Total Records: 768    
Features: 8 Independent Variables + 1 Target    
Target Column: Outcome

## ⚙️ Workflow

1- Import Libraries → pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn    
2- Load & Explore Data → Understand structure, check missing values, visualize relationships    
3- Data Preprocessing → Clean, normalize, and prepare data for modeling    
4- Train-Test Split → Divide data into training and testing sets    
5- Model Building → Experiment with different algorithms such as:    
- SVC(kernel='linear')    
6- Model Evaluation → Use metrics like Accuracy

---

## 📈 Results

The best-performing model was Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with kernel='linear'.    
Achieved an accuracy of approximately ~78%.    
Showed a balanced performance between Precision and Recall.
