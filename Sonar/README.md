# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning solution to classify sonar signals as either Rocks or Mines using the Sonar dataset. The goal is to accurately distinguish between metal cylindrical objects (mines) and rocks based on sonar frequency returns.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Binary Classification: Predict whether a sonar signal represents a Rock (R) or Mine (M)

Dataset: Contains 208 samples with 60 frequency features and 1 target variable
Challenge: Build an accurate classifier to help in underwater mine detection
